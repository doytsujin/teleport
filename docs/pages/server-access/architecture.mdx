This document provides an overview of key Teleport Server Access architecture features and concepts. 

## SSH Bastion Pattern

Teleport Server Access helps implementing the increasingly popular SSH best-practice *Bastion Pattern*.

## Events

### Defining Events

Teleport admin's can further define [Events](../../admin-guide.mdx#events) to organize and trigger sending session recordings to customizable storage back-ends:

1. All `session.start` events could be stored on AWS S3.
2. All `exec` events could be stored in a subdirectory on AWS S3 specific to remote commands.

This makes it easier to manage, group, and analyze sessions.

We recommend reading through the [Architecture documentation](../../architecture/authentication.mdx#audit-log) to plan out how to best implement sessions and events for your needs.
