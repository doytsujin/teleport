# Server Access

Teleport Server Access consolidates SSH access across all environments, decreases configuration complexity, supports industry best practices and compliance while giving complete visibility over all sessions and events.

Teleport Server Access is designed for the following kinds of scenarios:

1. When up to a vast number of clusters must be managed using the command-line (`tsh`) or programmatically (through the Teleport API) and you want to simplify your stack, security, and configuration complexity.
2. When it's important to track and audit every user session. 
3. When Teleport users require a complete, dedicated, and secure SSH option (Teleport Node running in SSH mode) and more than a certificate authority (Teleport Auth) with proxy (Teleport Proxy).
4. When resource and network security must be maximized: SSH certificates over secret keys, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Single Sign-On (SSO), and short-lived certificates.

## Features

Server Access features are organized into three main offerings: 

1. **Simplified/unified configuration and stack**: 
  - Multi-cluster management through a clean user interface and API when managing your many resources or devices.
  - Teleport Server Access allows full SSH management without third-party dependencies. 
  - Add functionality to Teleport through plugins.
  - [Reduce the likelihood of a dependency or tool vulnerability](https://www.cse.usf.edu/~xou/publications/esorics08.pdf) by reducing the complexity of your stack.
2. **Security and compliance**:
  - 2FA and One-Time Pass (OTP) support.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): built-in support for delegating permissions and access by the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP).
  - Support for OAuth 2.0, Open ID Connect, SAML, and SSO out-of-the-box.
  - Access Requests that can be approved or denied to define a compliance workflow.
3. **Complete visibility into access and behavior**:
  - Single and multi-user session auditing and recording.
  - Configure event streaming to record and send events to specific team members or destinations.
  - Unified resource management and [cluster introspection](https://goteleport.com/blog/openssh-vs-teleport/).
  - A convenient web UI for easily representing and interacting with resources and user sessions.
